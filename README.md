# SpringMaven-Multi-Module-Config
This is the spring maven multi module project set up and configuration
Discover how to create Spring Boot projects using multiple Maven modules and to keep your code-base more organised in the long run.
Most of the examples used to demonstrate Spring Boot are rather simple. A single Maven module is used. But, in the real world, developers are building complex applications and they want to structure their code across multiple modules. Will it be difficult? No, absolutely not:) We just need to modify a couple of things in order to make the project work:
- The Spring Boot main application class needs to be modified in order to let Spring know to scan for beans in all the Maven modules
- The Maven Build Plugin needs to be added in the pom.xml file of the Spring Boot main application class

And this is the completed spring maven project multi module project with configuration.
